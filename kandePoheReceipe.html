               <br>
               Prepare and keep aside your ingredients like chopped onions, boiled and cubed potatoes.<br>
               Take poha or flattened rice in a colander and rinse couple of times under running tap water, drain excess water and keep aside.<br>
               Heat oil in a pan or kadhai, add mustard seeds. Once they crackle, add Jeera or cumin seeds.<br>
               Once cumin turns slightly brown (roasted), add hing or asafoetida and roasted groundnuts. Saute them for a couple of seconds.<br>
               Now add curry leaves, green chillies, finely chopped onions, mix well and cook until the onions are translucent.<br>
               add the boiled and cubed potatoes and Turmeric powder. Mix well and cook for few seconds.<br>
               The washed and drained poha must have fluffed up well. Add salt to it and toss gently.<br>
               Now add the fluffed up poha to the kadhai or pan along with sugar and finely chopped coriander leaves.<br>
               Mix well and let it cook for a couple of minutes over low flame with lid on.<br>
               Switch off the flame, serve it piping hot in bowls or plates with a lime wedge, some grated coconut on top and some finely chopped coriander leaves.<br>
               f not serving for guests, then sqeeze the lemon juice in the kadhai itself (after switching off the flame) and then serve immediately.<br>
